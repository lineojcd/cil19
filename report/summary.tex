\section{Summary}
In conclusion, we presented new algorithms to extract roads from aerial images and compared them to existing baselines. We use 2 different fully convolutional architectures, Unet and FCN, which have delivered state of the art results in several semantic segmentation tasks.

Our models handily outperform the baselines and achieve an F1 score over 0.9. We showed that pre-trained models, with possibly unrelated datasets, yield excellent results in the road extraction task.

In the future, we would like to experiment with other types of fully convolutional architectures. The models we used are fairly outdated and current state of the art models will almost certainly produce better results.
