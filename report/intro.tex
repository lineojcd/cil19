\section{Introduction}

Enormous amounts of overhead images are captured daily by satelites and
airborne cameras. These can be leveraged not only for building digital
terrestrial maps but also for generating accurate maps of transportation
systems and lane based models. Data gathered is not limited to optical images
and includes data from remote sensing methods such as multispectral imaging and
LIDAR. 

A major hurdle is automating the process of identifying different features from
raw data so that the information can be used to enrich existing maps. Hence,
there has been considerable interest in pixel-wise labelling of aerial images.

In this report we restrict ourselves to binary (road or background) per-pixel
labelling of RGB images in a data set obtained from GoogleMaps. We include a
short survey of state-of-the-art in labelling of aerial images in Section
\ref{sec:related}, after which we describe our solution to the specified task.
